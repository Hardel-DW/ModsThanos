# Infinity Stone :
## Soul Stone  
It is an orange stone, the Crewmates have the particularity to see an arrow on their interfaces indicating the position of the stone.  
The main specificity of this stone is that the Crewmates can pick it up.  
When a "Crewmate" collects this stone, their name becomes orange and is visible to all.  
By killing the owner of the soul stone, this stone will then be randomly placed back on the map.  

## Stone of time:  
This is a green stone, which simply allows its activation to go back in time.  
All the movements and animation of the walk are reproduced exactly.  
In addition, if a Crewmate are dead, and the power is activated, This said Crewmate is then resurrected.  
(In case the Crewmate possesses the orange stone, it will lose it, and its name will become white again).

It is a red stone, which makes it possible to be invisible during a period.  
Thanos will see an effect of transparency, and the other players won't see Thanos anymore.  

## Space Stone:  
It is a blue stone, which allows the action of this one, to pose a dimensional portai.  
When several portals are placed, Thanos can imprint them like vents, and travel from portal to portal.  

## Mind Stone:  
It is a yellow stone, which allows its activation to take the appearance of someone, pseudo, costume, hat, colors, and pet.  
It has a temporary duration.  
Once the duration is over, the player is transformed back into himself.
